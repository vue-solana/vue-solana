# Vue Solana

Use this skill when helping with apps or libraries that use the Vue Solana ecosystem.

## Package Selection

- Use `@vue-solana/vue/kit` in Vue apps and `@vue-solana/nuxt/kit` in Nuxt apps for Kit primitives (types and values such as `Address`, `Commitment`, `Signature`, `address()`, `lamports()`, and `createSolanaClient()`). Build transaction messages with `@vue-solana/vue/kit` helpers (e.g. `createTransactionMessage()`, `compileTransaction()`); transactions flow through the packages as raw `Uint8Array` wire bytes. The default client is Kit's official stack: `solanaRpc()` installs the transaction planner and the signing/sending executors itself, and `createSolanaClient()` only composes them explicitly when a custom `commitment` is configured. The old custom fallback sender is not used.
- Use `@vue-solana/core` for framework-agnostic config, cluster endpoint helpers, wallet types, Wallet Standard adapters, Android Mobile Wallet Adapter registration, iOS browser wallet helpers, transaction helpers, and core subpath exports.
- Use `@vue-solana/vue` in Vue 3 apps for the plugin and composables.
- Use `@vue-solana/nuxt` in Nuxt apps for module setup and auto-imported composables.

Since v3.0.0 every `@vue-solana/*` package is ESM only (no `require` export condition, no top-level `main`). Never advise adding `@solana/kit` to a consumer's `package.json`: the `kit` subpaths re-export all of it. Four names exist in both Kit and this library — `SolanaError`, `SolanaErrorCode`, `isSolanaError`, `TransactionStatus` — and the package root resolves them to this library's versions, while the `/kit` subpath keeps Kit's. Import `isSolanaError` from `@vue-solana/*/kit` when checking Kit-thrown errors.

- Prefer `devnet` for examples and tests. Use `mainnet` for Solana mainnet; this is Solana's official mainnet cluster name. The legacy `mainnet-beta` spelling is still accepted and redirects to the same endpoint.

## Install Commands

For Vue:

```sh
pnpm add @vue-solana/vue
```

Vue apps do not need `@vue-solana/core` or `buffer` directly for primary composable, Kit primitive, or Buffer-helper usage.

For Nuxt:

```sh
npx nuxt module add @vue-solana/nuxt
```

Nuxt apps do not need `@vue-solana/core`, `@vue-solana/vue`, or `buffer` directly for primary module, composable, Kit primitive, or Buffer-helper usage.

## Vue Setup

Install the plugin once in the app entry:

```ts
import { createApp } from "vue";
import { createSolanaPlugin } from "@vue-solana/vue";
import App from "./App.vue";

const solana = createSolanaPlugin({
  cluster: "devnet",
  mobileWallet: {
    appIdentity: {
      name: "My Vue Solana App",
      uri: "https://example.com",
      icon: "favicon.ico",
    },
  },
});

createApp(App).use(solana).mount("#app");
// app.unmount(); solana.dispose();
```

Prefer direct composable subpath imports in Vue apps:

```ts
import { useAccountInfo } from "@vue-solana/vue/useAccountInfo";
import { useProgramAccounts } from "@vue-solana/vue/useProgramAccounts";
import { useRpc } from "@vue-solana/vue/useRpc";
import { useSignatureStatus } from "@vue-solana/vue/useSignatureStatus";
import { useSolanaPay } from "@vue-solana/vue/useSolanaPay";
import { useSolanaQrCode } from "@vue-solana/vue/useSolanaQrCode";
import { useTransactionConfirmation } from "@vue-solana/vue/useTransactionConfirmation";
import { useWallet } from "@vue-solana/vue/useWallet";
import { useWallets } from "@vue-solana/vue/useWallets";
```

## Nuxt Setup

Register the module in `nuxt.config.ts`:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ["@vue-solana/nuxt"],
  solana: {
    cluster: "devnet",
  },
});
```

Nuxt auto-imports these composables (source of truth: `packages/nuxt/src/imports.ts`):

- `useSolana()`, `useSolanaClient()`
- `useSolanaRpc()`, `useSolanaConnection()`
- `useSolanaWallet()`, `useSolanaWallets()`, `useSolanaSelectedWalletAccount()`
- `useSolanaAccountInfo()`, `useSolanaBalance()`, `useSolanaProgramAccounts()`, `useSolanaSignatureStatus()`, `useSolanaTransactionConfirmation()`, `useSolanaTokenAccounts()`, `useSolanaTokenBalance()`
- `useSolanaRequest()`, `useSolanaSubscription()`, `useSolanaTrackedData()`, `useSolanaAction()`, `useSolanaAirdrop()`
- `useSolanaSignMessage()`, `useSolanaSignIn()`
- `useSolanaSignAndSendTransaction()`, `useSolanaSignTransactions()`, `useSolanaSignAndSendTransactions()`, `useSolanaTransaction()`
- `useSolanaPayer()`, `useSolanaIdentity()`, `useSolanaPlanTransaction()`, `useSolanaPlanTransactions()`, `useSolanaSendTransaction()`, `useSolanaSendTransactions()`
- `useSolanaPay()`, `useSolanaPayConfirmation()`, `useSolanaQrCode()`, `useSolanaQrScanner()`
- `useSolanaClientCapability()`, `tryUseSolana()`, `clearSwrCache()`, `deleteSwrKey()`
- SWR adapters: `useSolanaRequestSwr()`, `useSolanaSubscriptionSwr()`, `useSolanaTrackedDataSwr()`
- Setup values for `solana.clientPlugin: false` (client-only `payer`): `createSolanaPlugin()`, `solanaInjectionKey()`, `selectedWalletAccountInjectionKey()`, `createSelectedWalletAccountContext()`

`useClientCapability` / `useSolanaClientCapability()` fail fast when the client lacks a capability (throws `MissingClientCapabilityError`, normalized to `SolanaError`). In Nuxt it's auto-imported as `useSolanaClientCapability()`; in plain Vue import from `@vue-solana/vue/useClientCapability` or rely on hooks that call it internally. `tryUseSolana()` returns the context or `null` without creating an SSR fallback. `createSolanaPlugin()` returns `dispose()` to stop wallet discovery/subscriptions; Nuxt wires it automatically.

The Nuxt runtime plugin is client-only. Composables are SSR-safe and may return inert state during SSR; run real RPC and wallet work after hydration, in client lifecycle hooks, or from user actions. The one exception is `useSolanaQrScanner()`: never call `start()` during SSR, and wrap scanner UI in `<ClientOnly>` (see Solana Pay).

Nuxt `ModuleOptions` intentionally omits `payer` and `payerSecretKey`. Direct `@vue-solana/core` and `@vue-solana/vue` clients accept both: `payer` is a Kit `TransactionSigner`, and `payerSecretKey` is a base64 64-byte Ed25519 keypair. Never put a raw secret or `payerSecretKey` in Nuxt public runtime config. Install a client-owned `payer` in a client-only plugin with `clientPlugin: false` so the module does not install a second plugin; a client-sent transaction always needs one.

## Wallet Flow

Use one public wallet flow for all supported wallet sources:

1. Use `useWallets()` or `useSolanaWallets()` to discover wallets and select one. Connecting a wallet disconnects every other discovered wallet (swept over discovery; uncached wallets disconnected via `standard:disconnect` with a 2 s timeout), so only one wallet stays authorized at a time. Per-wallet failures are swallowed and `connect()` resolves after the sweep.
2. Use `useWallet()` or `useSolanaWallet()` for active wallet state.
3. Call `connect()` only after selecting a wallet.
4. Treat `connected` as false until `connect()` resolves, even if an extension exposes previously authorized accounts.
5. Call `disconnect()` from the active wallet composable.

To persist a wallet choice across sessions, mount `SelectedWalletAccountProvider` once near the app root and use `useSelectedWalletAccount()` (or `useSolanaSelectedWalletAccount()` in Nuxt) to read and set the selected account. The Nuxt runtime plugin installs an app-wide selected-wallet-account context automatically, so `useSolanaSelectedWalletAccount()` works without a provider. The selection persists as `${walletName}:${accountAddress}` through `stateSync` (default `localStorage`), syncs across tabs, and is restored when the wallet reconnects.

Current wallet support:

- Browser extension wallets discovered through Solana Wallet Standard packages.
- Android native mobile wallets through `@solana-mobile/wallet-standard-mobile` on Android Chrome and Chrome PWAs.
- iOS browser wallets through wallet-specific universal links for Phantom, Solflare, and Backpack.
- Manual or custom wallet objects that implement `SolanaWallet`.

Current wallet limits:

- Desktop native app wallets are not implemented yet. They require wallet-specific protocol links or future native Wallet Standard registration.
- There is no built-in wallet modal. Apps should build their own selection UI with `useWallets()`.
- `autoConnect` is active behavior only when explicitly enabled. It may reconnect a restored, previously selected wallet, but must never be used to connect an arbitrary installed wallet.

## RPC, Account, And Balance Reads

Use `useRpc()` or `useSolanaRpc()` to show cluster, endpoint, connection status, latest blockhash, and `checkConnection()`.

Use `useBalance(address, commitment?)` or `useSolanaBalance(address, commitment?)` for lamport balances. The address is a base58 address string (or a ref/getter of one); pass `null` or `undefined` to disable the read.

Use `useAccountInfo(address, options?)` or `useSolanaAccountInfo(address, options?)` to read account data and optionally subscribe to account changes.

Use `useProgramAccounts(programId, config?)` or `useSolanaProgramAccounts(programId, config?)` for program-owned account scans. Program scans can be expensive on public RPC nodes; prefer narrow filters, `dataSlice`, and dedicated RPC infrastructure for production reads.

Use `useSignatureStatus(signature, options?)` or `useSolanaSignatureStatus(signature, options?)` to read or poll submitted transaction status. Polling uses chained timeouts; `stopPolling()` clears the timer and polling restarts when the signature changes. There is no per-call `commitment` option (`getSignatureStatuses` takes none) — set commitment on the endpoint or plugin. For per-call commitment, use `useTransactionConfirmation()`.

RPC, balance, account, program-account, and signature-status reads do not require a connected wallet.

## Data Layer (Request, Subscription, Tracked Data)

Use the Kit-reactive data composables for SWR-style reads instead of hand-rolled `watch` + `try/catch` state:

- `useRequest(source, options?)` or auto-imported `useSolanaRequest(source, options?)` for one-shot requests. The source may be a request function, a Kit request object (`rpc.getBalance(address)`), a `ref`/`computed` of either, or `null` to disable. Statuses: `fetching`, `success`, `error`, `disabled`.
- `useSubscription(source, options?)` or `useSolanaSubscription(...)` for live streams. The source is a Kit reactive stream source (for example `rpcSubscriptions.slotNotifications()`), a ref of it, or `null`. Statuses: `loading`, `loaded`, `error`, `disabled`. `reconnect()` re-opens with stale-while-revalidate.
- `useTrackedData(source, options?)` or `useSolanaTrackedData(...)` for RPC data seeded by a fetch and updated by a subscription (for example `getAccountInfo` + `accountNotifications`). The store slot-deduplicates both sources so out-of-order arrivals cannot regress the value.
- SWR cache adapters from `@vue-solana/vue/swr` (`useRequestSwr`, `useSubscriptionSwr`, `useTrackedDataSwr`) key results across mounts. Keys are namespaced per adapter; a `null` source clears the key's cache. Cache is capped at 1024 entries with oldest-first eviction; use `clearSwrCache()` or `deleteSwrKey(key)` (full key includes the adapter prefix). In Nuxt these are auto-imported as `useSolanaRequestSwr()`, `useSolanaSubscriptionSwr()`, `useSolanaTrackedDataSwr()`, plus `clearSwrCache()` and `deleteSwrKey()`; in plain Vue import from `@vue-solana/vue/swr`.
- `useAction(handler, options?)` or `useSolanaAction(handler, options?)` for generic async actions, backed by `createSolanaActionStore` from `@vue-solana/core/action`. The handler receives a fresh `AbortSignal` per call. Exposes `data`, `dispatch`, `error`, `isRunning`, `reset`, and `status` (`idle`, `running`, `success`, `error`). Re-dispatch aborts the in-flight call; failures keep the previous `data` for stale-while-revalidate.

For `useTrackedData`, the `rpcValueMapper` / `rpcSubscriptionValueMapper` callbacks receive the unwrapped value; the returned `data` ref keeps the full `SolanaRpcResponse` envelope (`data.value.value`, `data.value.context.slot`).

Tests touching these composables or real Kit reactive stores must run under the `node` vitest environment (Kit stores call Node's `setMaxListeners` on `AbortSignal`); tag the test file with `// @vitest-environment node`.

## Solana Pay

Solana Pay is implemented directly on Kit. No extra Solana Pay package is required, and `qrcode` is loaded lazily only when a QR code is rendered.

Core entry points:

- `@vue-solana/core/solana-pay`: `encodeURL()`, `encodeTransferRequestURL()`, `encodeTransactionRequestURL()`, `parseURL()`, `createQR()`, `createQRDataURL()`, `createQRCanvas()`, `createQROptions()`, and `ParseURLError`.
- `@vue-solana/core/solana-pay-confirmation`: `createSolanaPayReference()`, `verifySolanaPayPayment()`, `findTransactionSignaturesByReference()`.
- `@vue-solana/core/solana-pay-status`: `getSolanaPayPaymentStatus()`.

These helpers live in `@vue-solana/core`. In a Vue or Nuxt app prefer the composables below; if you call the helpers directly, add `@vue-solana/core` as a direct dependency, because a transitive copy is not resolvable from app source under pnpm's strict `node_modules`.

`encodeTransactionRequestURL()` only builds the URL: the linked HTTPS endpoint, its authorization, and the transaction it returns are the app's responsibility, and this library never fetches or signs the linked transaction.

Amounts are `bigint` lamports (`100_000_000n` encodes `amount=0.1`), while `recipient`, `splToken`, and `reference` are Kit `Address` values. A `reference` is a lookup key, never proof of payment on its own.

Vue composables (Nuxt auto-imports all four):

- `useSolanaPay()`: `createTransferRequest({ recipient, amount, splToken?, label?, message?, memo? })` mints a reference, returns the URL string, and fills `requestUrl`, `parsedRequest`, `reference`, `status` (`idle`, `pending`, `found`, `confirmed`, `finalized`, `expired`, `error`), `loading`, and `error`. `parseRequest(value)` parses untrusted input, `createReference()` mints a standalone reference, `confirmTransfer(options?)` verifies against the parsed request and stores the outcome, and `reset()` clears state.
- `useSolanaPayConfirmation()`: `startPolling(rpc, reference, 2_000)` / `stopPolling()` plus `check(rpc, reference)` over the cheaper non-verifying `getSolanaPayPaymentStatus()`. Pass the `rpc` surface from `useSolanaClient()`; polling stops on unmount.
- `useSolanaQrCode()`: `generate(url, { size, background, color })` resolves an SVG string (render with `v-html`; the markup comes from the encoder, not user input) and `reset()` clears it. The option values are forwarded positionally to `createQR(url, size, background, color)`, so pass all three keys or none — `{ size: 320 }` alone is fine, but `{ size: 320, color: "#000" }` would put the color in the background slot. Use `createQRDataURL()` for a percent-encoded `data:` URL that needs no `Buffer` polyfill.
- `useSolanaQrScanner()`: camera plus `BarcodeDetector` scanning. `start({ video, scanIntervalMs })`, `stop()`, `reset()`, and `scanFromText(text)` for a paste fallback. It is browser-only: never call `start()` during SSR, and wrap scanner UI in `<ClientOnly>` in Nuxt. When `BarcodeDetector` is unavailable the camera still opens but nothing is detected, so always offer a paste field.

Security boundaries: parse every scanned or pasted URL before displaying it; show recipient, amount, token, and memo and require an explicit user action before any wallet prompt; never auto-send; fulfil only when `verifySolanaPayPayment()` returns `verified: true`; never store private keys or secrets in client code or Nuxt public runtime config.

The example apps' `SolanaPayPanel` (request, QR, status polling, settlement verification) and `SolanaPayScannerPanel` (scan or paste, parsed preview, wallet handoff with no send path) are runnable references.

## Sign In With Solana

Use `useSignIn()` or `useSolanaSignIn()` to trigger a wallet's SIWS feature. `signIn(input?)` resolves `{ account, signedMessage, signature }` for **server-side verification**: verify the signature against `account.publicKey` on your backend before trusting the identity (see the message-signing guide). The adapter verifies message/sign-in signatures against the account's public key (best-effort, rejects malformed signatures even if Ed25519 unavailable) and binds sign-in results to the requested account (rejects mismatch/unknown accounts with `INVALID_SIGNATURE`). State exposes `status` (`idle`, `signing-in`, `signed-in`, `error`), `loading`, `error`, and `signInResult`; wallet cancellations normalize to `USER_REJECTED`.

The composable does not auto-connect: `signIn()` rejects with `WALLET_NOT_CONNECTED` when no wallet is connected.

## Error Handling

Vue Solana normalizes common failures into `SolanaError` from `@vue-solana/core/errors`. Public examples and docs should branch on stable `error.code` values instead of rendering raw error objects or parsing wallet/RPC messages.

Stable codes:

- `NO_WALLET_SELECTED`
- `WALLET_NOT_CONNECTED`
- `WALLET_FEATURE_UNSUPPORTED`
- `WALLET_FAILURE`
- `USER_REJECTED`
- `INVALID_ADDRESS`
- `INVALID_INPUT`
- `TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT`
- `TRANSACTION_NOT_FOUND`
- `TRANSACTION_FAILED`
- `REDIRECT_TIMEOUT`
- `DECRYPTION_FAILED`
- `RPC_FAILURE`
- `STORAGE_FAILURE`
- `MISSING_CLIENT_CAPABILITY`
- `INVALID_SIGNATURE`

Use `error.cause` only for debugging/logging the original wallet adapter, RPC, parsing, timeout, or storage failure. Do not show raw `cause` details to users by default.

Vue composables expose `Ref<SolanaError | null>` error refs. Nuxt auto-imported composables expose the same error shape.

```ts
const message = computed(() => {
  switch (error.value?.code) {
    case "NO_WALLET_SELECTED":
      return "Choose a wallet first.";
    case "USER_REJECTED":
      return "The wallet request was rejected.";
    case "TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT":
      return "The transaction is taking longer than expected.";
    case "RPC_FAILURE":
      return "The Solana RPC request failed.";
    default:
      return null;
  }
});
```

## Transactions

Use `useSignAndSendTransaction()` or `useSolanaSignAndSendTransaction()` after a wallet is selected and connected. This wallet flow can return after RPC submission or wait for a selected commitment with `confirm: true`.

Use `useSendTransaction()` / `useSendTransactions()` (and their Nuxt aliases) for client-owned signing. The default client exposes Kit's official planner and signing/sending capabilities (`solanaRpc()` installs them; `createSolanaClient()` re-adds them explicitly for a custom `commitment`). The official executor waits for `confirmed` commitment before the composable reports `sent`, with no wallet popup. Configure `payer`, and keep funded keys in a trusted server or relayer context.

The active wallet must support either `signAndSendTransaction` or `signTransaction`. Android Mobile Wallet Adapter wallets prefer `signTransaction` plus app-side RPC submission when available so the app can reliably return the submitted signature.

Use `useTransactionConfirmation()` or `useSolanaTransactionConfirmation()` when an app already has a submitted signature and wants to wait for a requested commitment separately from signing and sending.

Use `useTransaction(handler, { timeoutMs? })` or `useSolanaTransaction()` to track `{ signature, loading, error }` around a custom transaction builder. A newer execution supersedes an in-flight one, and a timeout normalizes to `TRANSACTION_TIMEOUT`.

Use `useAirdrop()` or `useSolanaAirdrop()` on devnet/testnet/local validators to dispatch `(address, lamports)`. It requires the client's `airdrop` capability (installed by `rpcAirdrop()` in the default client) and a `payer` signer. Rate-limited or drained faucets normalize to `RPC_FAILURE` with an actionable message; point users at `https://faucet.solana.com` or a local validator.

For batch flows, use `useSignTransactions()` / `useSolanaSignTransactions()` (sign multiple transactions in one wallet request) and `useSignAndSendTransactions()` / `useSolanaSignAndSendTransactions()` (sign and send a batch). Both prefer the wallet's batch capability: `useSignTransactions` falls back to the legacy `signAllTransactions` feature, while `useSignAndSendTransactions` falls back to sending sequentially with the singular capability. A partial batch send rejects with `PartialSignAndSendError` (from `@vue-solana/vue/useSignAndSendTransactions`); its `signatures` array lists the transactions already submitted, so inspect it before retrying to avoid double-spends.

When browser transaction code needs `Buffer`, use the framework package helper:

```ts
import { installSolanaBufferPolyfill } from "@vue-solana/vue/buffer-polyfill";

installSolanaBufferPolyfill();
```

Use `@vue-solana/nuxt/buffer-polyfill` for the same helper in Nuxt apps. Use `@vue-solana/core/buffer-polyfill` only for framework-agnostic core usage.

Do not assign the Buffer global manually in public examples.

Since 4.0.0 the root barrels no longer re-export `Buffer` or `installSolanaBufferPolyfill`; always import the `buffer-polyfill` subpath so the polyfill is not pulled into every consumer's initial chunk.

## Client Capabilities, Payer, Identity, And Transaction Planning

- `useClientCapability(methods, options?)` / `useSolanaClientCapability()` fail fast when the installed Solana client does not expose a named capability, throwing `MissingClientCapabilityError` (extends `SolanaError`, code `MISSING_CLIENT_CAPABILITY`). Auto-imported in Nuxt as `useSolanaClientCapability()`. `tryUseSolana()` returns the context or `null` without creating an SSR fallback; `useSolana()` returns a fresh inert SSR context per call if uninstalled. `createSolanaPlugin()` returns `dispose()` to stop wallet discovery/subscriptions (Nuxt wires automatically).
- `usePayer()` / `useIdentity()` (or `useSolanaPayer()` / `useSolanaIdentity()`) expose the Kit client's `payer` / `identity` `TransactionSigner`, re-read on change when the client advertises `subscribeToPayer` / `subscribeToIdentity`. A direct Vue/core client can receive `payer` through plugin options; custom clients can install signer plugins (e.g. `generatedPayer()` / `generatedIdentity()` from `@solana/kit-plugin-signer`). Nuxt does not forward payer options through public runtime config.
- `usePlanTransaction()` / `usePlanTransactions()` (or `useSolanaPlanTransaction()` / `useSolanaPlanTransactions()`) expose the client's transaction planning capability. `usePlanTransaction` requires `planTransaction` and `payer`; `usePlanTransactions` requires `planTransactions` and `payer`. Kit reads `client.payer` to set the fee payer, so a client-sent transaction always needs one.
- `useSendTransaction()` / `useSendTransactions()` (or `useSolanaSendTransaction()` / `useSolanaSendTransactions()`) plan, sign, submit, and confirm through the client's sending executor. Same rule: they require `sendTransaction`/`sendTransactions` **and** `payer`.

## Common Gotchas

- Do not import Solana primitives from `@solana/web3.js`, `@solana/web3-compat`, or the removed `@vue-solana/*/web3` subpaths in new Vue Solana examples; use `@vue-solana/vue/kit`, `@vue-solana/nuxt/kit`, or `@vue-solana/core/kit` for the Kit primitive surface.
- v2.0.0 removed `@solana/web3-compat` from every package, deleted the `web3` subpaths, dropped the `connection` field from the context, and removed the declaration shims v1 published for the broken `web3-compat` metadata. Do not suggest local `types/web3-compat.d.ts` shims; upgrade examples to `@vue-solana/*@^2` instead.
- Do not split browser, Android mobile, iOS browser, and future desktop native wallet sources into separate public flows. Keep them unified through `useWallets()` and `useWallet()`.
- Do not mark a discovered wallet as connected just because accounts are visible. Connection state begins after `connect()` succeeds.
- In Nuxt, avoid server-side RPC and wallet actions unless the app explicitly provides server-safe behavior. Keep `payerSecretKey` and all raw secrets out of public runtime config; create client-owned signers in a client-only plugin and set `clientPlugin: false`.
- Public Solana RPC endpoints can be rate-limited. For production, suggest a dedicated RPC provider and custom `endpoint`.
- When example-app behavior changes, extend the Playwright e2e suite (`e2e/`) rather than relying on unit tests alone. `mockSolanaRpc(page)` answers the reads the examples use (including `getSignaturesForAddress` and `getTransaction` for Solana Pay settlement), and `mockSolanaSubscriptions(page)` fakes the Kit RPC-subscriptions websocket protocol (subscribe, id-correlated result, then `<method>Notification` frames keyed on `params.subscription`); see the E2E Testing guide. Never depend on a real camera in CI: the scanner spec stubs `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` with a canvas `captureStream()` and a fake `BarcodeDetector`.

## Verification Checklist

For changes inside the Vue Solana repository, run these from the repo root:

```sh
pnpm format
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build:packages
pnpm build:examples
pnpm --filter docs build
pnpm smoke:standalone-installs
pnpm test:e2e
```

After touching a barrel, `exports` map, or `package.json` `files`, also run `pnpm check:entries`, `pnpm check:esm-map`, `pnpm check:externals`, `pnpm check:buffer-polyfill-declarations`, `pnpm size:packages`, and `pnpm pack:size`.

For consumer app examples, verify the app starts and the relevant flow works on `devnet`. For wallet or transaction work, include manual browser testing with a Solana wallet when feasible. For Solana Pay settlement, note that the automated suite only covers the no-payment (`expired`) branch; confirm a real `confirmed` result manually with a wallet.
